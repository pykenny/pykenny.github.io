</figcaption></figure><p>If you see this article appears on the top of this website, then congratulates! You're probably one of the folks who witnesses its birth.</p>
<p>Also, don't be upset if you're not among the early birds! As the blog's name states, it will be used to record some insightful tech topics I got from the internet, books, and real cases, plus development log of the site itself. I hope you will get some useful information from this site and like the bear cub's photo on the top (credit: <a class="reference external" href="https://unsplash.com/photos/mKnBilvLNnY">Unsplash</a>).</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
</section><section id="so-who-are-you-the-writer"><h2>"So... who are you (the writer)?"</h2>
<p>I totally understand you're not satisfied with the one-line description in the top banner, and I believe all of you definitely have some area where you tackle with the details deeper and better than me, such as physics, athletics, philosophies, mythologies, culinary arts, finding directions (all what I'm bad at, to be honest), etc.. And of course, computer science and software techniques included.</p>
<p>So long story short, I got my CS degree in Boston around an year ago, and experienced lots of fun stuff in this city: lobsters, cream pies, donuts (not just <a class="reference external" href="https://www.dunkindonuts.com/en">Dunkin</a>'s), cream pies, clam chowder, Japanese ramen shops (yes, you didn't misread!), pumpkin spice everywhere (Ummmm), yucky salt water taffies (Urghh), and of course, my first job outside of campus and the horrible COVID-19 pandemic outbreak.</p>
<p>In late 2020, I started to work on this website as a personal project and as a challenge. The progress halted for a while when preparing for the way back to my hometown, Taipei, but soon continued after finishing up all the quarantine procedures, and finally got a workable version in March 2021. Its structure might be disastrous like Frankenstein now, but in my free time I'll try to improve it and add more functionalities. Maybe one day the manmade creature will finally get its PhD degree and Nobel Peace Prize (disclaimer: that's just some metaphor, not promise).</p>

<figcaption><p>Really hard to notice the favicon when opening up too much browser tabs, isn't it?</p>
</figcaption></figure><p>The icon consists of two of my favorite things: tea, and fox images (domesticated foxes are challenging to raise and only legal in few areas). Both make me relax, and I'd love to share the delight to the visitors about what I learned (and maybe some funny images and memes as well), just as how these things brings me happiness.</p>
<p>And as for the first few articles, I'm planning to explain how this site is constructed from scratch. Maybe the actual amount will be much more than I expected, but I'm really happy to share all the details about the magical web technology I've never known decade ago along with painful sweats and lessons learned during these months (don't stress out, and I also hope you can circumvent these mistakes!).</p>
